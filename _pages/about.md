Hi! I'm a PhD student in the [Atmosphere & Ocean Dynamics group](https://www.atm.damtp.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge. My supervisors are [Prof. Peter Haynes](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/phh/) and [Prof. John Taylor](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/jrt51/). My current reserach focus is the problem of stratospheric hydration by convective overshoots in the tropics. We study the idealised problem of convective penetration of a buoyant plume into a stably stratified layer using numerical simulations to understand the mechanisms at play. My research interests cover a wide range of atmospheric phenomena, from large scales (QBO, internal gravity waves) to small (turbulent mixing, convection).
